This project focuses on the design and implementation of an SRT radix-2 divider for unsigned integers using 
Verilog HDL on an FPGA. The division algorithm, based on the digit recurrence method, iteratively generates 
quotient bits by employing a lookup table for quotient digit selection. The design was implemented and 
verified using Verilog HDL and synthesized onto an FPGA platform. Performance metrics, including area 
utilization and maximum operating frequency, were analyzed. The implemented divider demonstrates the 
feasibility of high-performance division using the SRT algorithm on FPGAs, offering a balance between speed 
and hardware resources.
